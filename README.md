# Optimum Multiparameter Analysis 
The knowledge about exact mixing fractions of water masses in the oceans is necessary for various applications and in particular when analyzing transient tracer fields or biogeochemical cycling.

The distribution of tracers in the ocean is generally controlled by a combination of transport processes associated with the oceanic circulation and mixing and by reactive processes associated with the major biogeochemical cycles.

OMP analysis is a tool for oceanographers, geochemists as well as all people interested in separating mixing signals and biogeochemical cycling signals from hydrographic data.

This page is used to discuss general aspects of the OMP (Optimum Multiparameter) analysis as well as to freely distribute a MATLAB based software to analyse oceanic mixing situations with the aid of the OMP analysis.
